# awscreds
üé¢ Tool to view and rotate personal aws credentials.

```
usage: awscreds [-h] {rotate,view} ...

manage aws creds

positional arguments:
  {rotate,view}
    rotate       generate a new access key, and update local config with the
                 key
    view         view aws creds
```
